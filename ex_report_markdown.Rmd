## Welcome to the workshop
**knitr** allows you to combine your data analysis and reporting
in a single document. You can choose how much R code will actually
be displayed in the generated report. In any case, if needed, you will
always be able to easily access all code used to generate the output
presented in your report. This goes in the direction of literate
programming:

> I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better
documentation of programs, and that we can best achieve this by
considering programs to be works of literature.   
Knuth (1992)

In this sample report, we just want to check that your system is set
up properly to participate in the workshop. Please make sure you
manage to compile this report and that the resulting HTML file looks
like the provided reference HTML file.

## Generating some data and making plots 
We will simulate some meaningless data to have some values to plot and
represent in tables. The code to simulate the data is shown below:

```{r ex2_simdata, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
set.seed(42) # for reproducibility
## simulated values of two genes for samples from different batches
gene1_b1 <- sort(abs(rnorm(30, mean = 2, sd = 1)))
gene1_b1_groups <- rep(c("control", "case"), times = c(11, 19))
gene1_b2 <- sort(abs(rnorm(20, mean = 4, sd = 0.5)))
gene1_b2_groups <- rep(c("control", "case"), times = c(12, 8))

## put the simulated data in a data frame
orig_df <-
    data.frame(by = as.factor(rep(c("batch 1", "batch 2"), 
                                  times = c(30, 20))),
               vals = c(gene1_b1, gene1_b2),
               cat = as.factor(c(gene1_b1_groups, gene1_b2_groups)))
``` 


Assume these values are measured intensities for a specific gene
extracted from a larger experiment. The samples were processed in two
batches. We call a customized plotting function to get a first
idea of what the data look like (code not shown in the report).

```{r ex2_plot1, fig.height = 4}
my_R_function(df = orig_df, y_lab = "log2(expression)", 
              title = "original data")
``` 

There seems to be a batch effect which we would like to remove with a
simple $z$-transform:
```{r ex2_ztransf, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
norm_df <-
    data.frame(by = as.factor(rep(c("batch 1", "batch 2"), 
                                  times = c(30, 20))),
               vals = c(scale(gene1_b1), scale(gene1_b2)),
               cat = as.factor(c(gene1_b1_groups, gene1_b2_groups)))
``` 

To see the effect of our batch effect removal step, we want to plot
both, the original and the corrected data next to each other (code not
shown in the report):
```{r ex2_plot2, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 12, out.width = "750px"}
## plot original data
plot1 <- my_R_function(df = orig_df, y_lab = "log2(intensity)", 
                       y_lim = c(-2.5, 5),  title = "original data")
## plot modified data
plot2 <- my_R_function(df = norm_df, y_lab = "adjusted log2(intensity)", 
                       y_lim = c(-2.5, 5),  title = "adjusted data")
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)   
``` 

We can use expressions of the form `` `r ` `` to use R code inline. For
example, we see that the $z$-transformation
brings the `r sum(orig_df[, "by"] == "batch 1")` samples from
batch 1 on the same scale as the `r sum(orig_df[, "by"] == "batch 2")` 
samples from batch 2. The sample counts in the previous
sentence are obtained with inline R statements such as
`` ` ```` r sum(orig_df[, "by"] == "batch 1")` ``.

### Let's add a table of values
The R package *xtable* is of great help to nicely display
data frames as tables in a report. As an example, we present the
sample counts per batch and per category in a table using the
following code:
```{r ex2_table, echo = TRUE, results = "asis"}
print(xtable(table(orig_df[, c("by", "cat")]), align = "lcc"), type = "html")
``` 

## Information about the R session
It is always a good idea to include information about the R session
(version of R and used packages) in which the current report was
generated:

```{r ex2_rsession, echo = TRUE}
print(sessionInfo(), locale = FALSE)
``` 

## End of sample file
That was it. If you produce the HTML of this report on your laptop, you
should get a document that looks very similar to the file
*final_report_markdown.html* in the GitHub repository. If this is
not the case, you have to fix the problems (e.g. install missing
software) before the workshop in order to be able to fully
participate.
